# [90. meÄ‘unarodni POLJOPRIVREDNI SAJAM](https://www.sajam.net/sr/kalendar-2023/prolece/90-medjunarodni-poljoprivredni-sajam)

**20 - 26. maj 2023. Novi Sad**

**Quick facts**:

* 140,000 visitors in 7 days
* 21 participating countries
* 1,100 exhibitors

Why I went there: I believe that agriculture is the next big story for IT. Food will always be needed, while producing it becomes increasingly difficult in a world of constant updated restrictions. Meanwhile, IT barely glances at agriculture, not considering this market as a place to apply efforts. Nonetheless, in terms of equipment cost (700,000 euros for a combine harvester) and the ability to calculate investments years in advance - this market is no worse than those traditional for IT.

## How I would categorize the exhibitors:

1. Companies offering IT services
2. Companies offering IT solutions
3. Companies offering IT and high-tech components
4. All others, including those offering animals, fertilizers, manufacturing and selling parts, components, machinery, and so forth, which I would classify as traditional exhibitors.

## Companies offering IT services:

I came across one such company: [Agricon](https://www.agricon.de) from Hungary. The company provides a service for mapping fields, including soil composition, plant conditions, among other factors. The product includes a web portal, mapping equipment, and a mapping service (using the contractor's equipment). The value for the customer: mapping allows you to save on fertilizers, irrigation, and more. On the portal, you can not only study the results of measurements, but also plan fieldwork. The package includes a workshop on 'digital plant growing'.

## Companies providing IT solutions.

About a dozen and a half companies offered turnkey solutions in various areas, but I would narrow it down to four categories:

1. Static sensor systems for measuring weather parameters, plants, soil, water, storage systems. Designed for open fields, premises, farms, production complexes. Communication systems are also provided along with a set of equipment. The protocols are quite standard. For example, at the YU.net booth, there were sensors on LoRaWAN and Grafana, drawing a temperature graph.
2. Computer vision systems, statistical analysis of accumulated data - this is more for livestock farms, poultry farms. The main idea is a very attentive and meticulous observer for a huge number of indicators, capable of drawing conclusions from the main set: mortality, fertility, diseases, and much more. Similar systems for crop production, but the nature is simpler: saturation with salts, water, plant density. For example, the company [agro.net](https://digitalfarming.eu).
3. Navigation and autopilot systems. Primarily - navigation, both by satellite and by ground positioning stations. As noted by the representative of the company [Moveit doo](https://traktorskenavigacije.rs/autopilot/): "Navigation and autopilot will drive the tractor, but you will have to pull the levers yourself".
4. Solar panel systems and uninterrupted power supply, including - portable. I was not very interested in this direction - the equipment among them is quite standard.

## Companies selling components

Most of the components sold separately or as part of the systems provided are manufactured in China. Whereas the software is more often produced in Europe (Germany, Italy). More often, they sell components for self-assembly and installation that do not presuppose integration (autonomous lighting, weather stations, navigation and map systems).

## All the rest

Impressive technology, scales, techniques, peculiar beauty. There's a lot of high-tech in all of this, but it's not my specialty.

## The current state

**As from EU** [link](https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-10/Serbia%20Report%202022.pdf)
> As regards horizontal issues, the adoption of the next national programme for agriculture and rural development for the period 2022-2024 is pending. Its complementarity with the IPARD III programme should be ensured. The revision and update of the action plan on alignment with the EU acquis on agriculture and rural development should be finalised in the course of 2022. Serbia should speed up the establishment of the integrated administration and control system (IACS), and the transition from manual to electronic processing of aid applications. The procurement of software for the land parcel identification system (LPIS), a pre-condition for the start of the IPA 2021 project on the 1st phase of establishment of IACS, should be fulfilled without any further delays. Progress must be made in decoupling payments from production and linking area-based payments to cross-compliance standards. The farm accountancy data network (FADN) is established, but its sample size and the quality of the data needs to be further improved to be fully representative.
