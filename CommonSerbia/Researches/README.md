Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 caused the displacement of millions of Ukrainians while also triggering mass emigration from Russia on a scale not seen arguably since the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. It is estimated that over 800,000 people have left Russia since the start of the war, relocating to diverse destinations including Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia, Serbia, Turkey and Germany. The motivations for moving abroad are multiple and often overlapping, from fear of political repression and avoidance of military conscription to concerns over Russia’s increasing isolation and poor economic prospects. Russian migrants find themselves dispersed as temporary residents in countries like Turkey, Serbia and several former Soviet republics, asylum seekers in the United States and the European Union, or perpetually on the move between several visa-free destinations around the world.

This article provides an overview of recent migration trends from Russia, looks at the profiles of Russian migrants abroad, their main destination countries, future prospects as well as the impact of this migration on transit and destination countries. It also briefly considers the likelihood of continued or onward migration by analyzing ongoing changes in the political and economic landscape, both in Russia and abroad.
