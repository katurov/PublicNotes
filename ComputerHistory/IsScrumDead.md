I was told that, of course, Agile is all about project management because that phrase appears in the Manifesto. The Agile Manifesto was written a quarter century ago. How agile would we be if we hadn't learned and adapted over those 24 years? Back then, everybody thought in terms of projects. The notion that a product focus was better appeared on the scene about 7-8 years ago, if I remember correctly, and it's now dominant. In fact, the Manifesto signatories that I know don't use "project" anymore. Similarly, we've learned to deliver work every few days‚Äîa "couple months" is now considered suboptimal. Very few orgs outside of megacorporations or government contractors create "comprehensive documentation," and they're not in the least bit Agile. So, the details have changed a bit, but the thinking that underlies the values and principles is still quite valid (and valuable). To me, an Agile shop embodies that core thinking. In any event, the Manifesto was never intended to be anything other than a snapshot in time. It was never intended to be fixed-in-concrete doctrine. To be Agile, you need to be‚Äîagile;

There is no such thing as ‚ÄúAgile project management.‚Äù Agile teams are self-organizing and self-managing. They get to decide what to work on, when to do the work, and how to do the work. There are no team-level managers, or if someone does have that title, it is a support role, not a traditional management role.

Moreover, we work on entire products, not projects, so there are no projects to manage.

Finally, the main job of a *traditional* project manager is to keep the project "on time and within budget."  We can deliver something of value _at_ a particular time and within a given budget, but only if scope can change continuously as we learn. The idea of delivering something specific that was decided months ago "on time" strikes me as nonsensical. A traditional project manager would be baffled by what I just said :-).

Of course, to pull this off, you need an organizational culture of trust and respect. Most companies that talk about ‚ÄúAgile project management‚Äù have neither. The entire management hierarchy, in fact, is often built on the notion that you can't trust the people below you on the hierarchy. That's an odd concept when you think about it. If you can't trust them, why did you hire them? You trust them to build something using tools and techniques entirely alien to you. Why can't you trust them to build something useful without a "manager" acting as a baby sitter?

I keep hearing about "the Agile methodology." FWIW, "Agile" is NOT a methodology, process, or framework. In fact, more often than not, those things are an obstacle to agility. Backlogs, SMs, POs, Sprints, Sprint Reviews, Kanban boards, Scrum boards, definitions of done, definitions of ready, daily Scrums/standups, any mandated or required meeting, optimizing for output or capacity, accountability, team-level management, estimation (including story points), pushing work onto the teams ... NONE of these have anything at all to do with Agile. Of course, an Agile team can do those things if they want, but they are neither mandatory nor necessary.

What is necessary is putting people first (including trusting them to do the work in whatever way they see fit), getting working high-quality software into people's hands quickly (daily is good), collaborating (both on the team and with customers), and welcoming change at any time, even (especially) during development. Also, continuous improvement (maybe with retros, maybe not) is assumed. Anything you can do to further those ends is Agile. Period.

When talking about team autonomy, I find that many people get the wrong idea. It is not kindergarten. Developers are not two-year-olds doing whatever pops into their heads without considering the consequences. Autonomous teams _always_ work within constraints, budget being one of them, and working towards strategic objectives defined by the business is another.  Autonomous teams are not ignorant of how a business works. In fact, learning how to operate within a business is an important prerequisite to autonomy.

What autonomy does mean is that the team can work in whatever way suits them best *within* those constraints without management looming over them and trying to impose controls on the way that work is done. The team also decides what to work on, but that decision is rooted in a strong understanding of the product, of the market/customers, and of those strategic objectives I mentioned earlier. 

Practically, what autonomy gives you is getting better products out the door faster. That's a result anybody can get behind (except for ego-driven managers who place control over effectiveness).

Without a culture of trust and respect, none of this is possible. So, if you say, "We can't do that here," look closely at your organizational culture and try to change it so that you _can_ do that here.

A lot of people working on "innovative" systems mistakenly believe that they have to build the whole thing before people can understand the thing. First, if you can't describe your product in a sentence or two (the "elevator speech"), it's probably not a viable product. Exactly what single problem does it solve? If there's more than one, the product is too complex. Also, building it in the hopes that people will like it without considerable feedback as you're building rarely works.  It's a _very_ risky way to proceed.

It's best to identify the core of the core of the core of the core customer problem your product will solve (a Reis-style "MVP"), build that, get feedback, and adjust. Once that's solid, grow that seed product incrementally if needed. Often, that MVP turns out to be a salable product. If your feedback is "This is Great!", you're done. If it's "This is great, but..." you've got more work to do.

A little market research before you start is not a bad thing, but you won't know if you're building the right thing until you get that MVP into people's hands, so don't spend too much time on that research. Research the core functionality.

Does anybody else see the irony in the fact that Scrum is usually imposed on the teams by management, but the Scrum Guide says "[teams] are‚Ä¶self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and HOW." How does one reconcile self-management with being forced into a framework?

Scrum is in decline (thankfully). It's interesting, however, that many people immediately go to "What other framework is replacing Scrum?" As Sander points out üëá, how about *no* framework? Frameworks have never done anybody any good because they don't transfer. Frameworks come and go precisely because none of them "work."

Consider NUMMI, a joint effort between GM and Toyota. When run by GM, the plant was one of the worst-performing in the country. Toyota turned it into one of the best in a matter of months. Central to that change was the notion that the best people to figure out the best way to work are the people doing the work. Each autonomous team was responsible for improving in whatever way they deemed fit, and they had the active help and support of management in making any changes. The approach was a huge success.

GM then decided to document the processes and take them to Detroit, where the teams were ordered to adopt them. The transfer was a spectacular failure. GM simply didn't realize that, the key driver of success was the teams ability to figure out how to do their own work. It was not the process; it was the autonomy. A process that works well for the team that originated it may not work at all for anybody else. I should also point out that by the time those processes were installed in Detroit, the processes had changed back at NUMMI. The processes changed constantly as the teams learned. Ways of working are not static. Frameworks are.

Frameworks are all the equivalent of taking a process that worked well for one team and forcing it down the throats of everybody else, and the results are the same ones that GM witnessed. Every team is unique. Every team needs to develop their own way of working. That has to be done from a position of knowledge, of course. Random flailing around is like 1,000 monkeys typing Shakespeare. Learning, then, has to be a normal work activity and has to be actively supported by the organization.
